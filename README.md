PACMAN is an iconic arcade game from Atari 2600. This game is redesigned in such a way that an AI model understands the environment and the current situation and plays accordingly. The game environment is used from OpenAI’s gym framework which has got the environment of similar arcade games. The actors in this environment are trained using DQN model which follows Q-learning approach to present rewards to the model.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A Collaborative Document can be used for teams working on the same project. Instead of working on separate documents, they can use the Collaborative Document to work together in real time.
Any changes made in the doc will be visible to all users with the link so the same document doesn’t need to be shared multiple times. This saves time and increases efficiency in working.
