PACMAN is an iconic arcade game from Atari 2600. This game is redesigned in such a way that an AI model understands the environment and the current situation and plays accordingly. The game environment is used from OpenAIâ€™s gym framework which has got the environment of similar arcade games. The actors in this environment are trained using DQN model which follows Q-learning approach to present rewards to the model.



### Built With

* Open-AI's Gym Toolkit
* DQN: Deep Q Network




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The PACMAN problem environment helps us in understanding the Reinforcement algorithm concepts. This game environment can be related to real world scenarios and the model built can be used to solve using the deep reinforcement algorithms.
Eg: This model can be used to navigate people past dynamic obstacles in an optimistic path.
